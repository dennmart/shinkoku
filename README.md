# Shinkoku (深刻)

Shinkoku (Japanese, literally meaning *serious* or *severe*) is a single page app built using [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) to fetch and display your current critical items from [WaniKani](https://www.wanikani.com/). Simply enter your WaniKani API key (which can be found in their [API documentation](https://www.wanikani.com/api))!

## Requirements

The only requirements you must have installed are Node.js and NPM ([Installation instructions](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node)).

## Development Setup

* After installing Node.js and NPM, run `npm install` in the root directory to install all dependencies.
* Use the included gulpfile to start a webserver and load the page by running `gulp`.
